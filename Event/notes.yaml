  This data model is based on the standard UNE178503. It is also compatible with schema.org. Some of the elements of schema.org has been adapted in this file https://smart-data-models.github.io/data-models/schema-org.json. This Type can be used on its own to describe a general TouristDestination, or be used as an additionalType to add tourist relevant properties to any other Place. A TouristDestination is defined as a Place that contains, or is colocated with, one or more TouristAttractions, often linked by a similar theme or interest to a particular touristType. The UNWTO defines Destination (main destination of a tourism trip) as the place visited that is central to the decision to take the trip.
